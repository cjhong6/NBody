The goal for this project is to write a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">Law of Universal Gravitation</a>.

Ultimately, I will be creating a program NBody.java that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.
